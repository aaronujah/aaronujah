# Aaron Ujah

**Engineer at the frontier of software systems 🛠️, AI-powered products 🤖, and cloud-native infrastructure ☁️.**

I design backends that scale, build AI-driven tools that adapt, and craft systems that bridge people, data, and automation. My work spans intelligent APIs, distributed architectures, and cloud deployments—all shaped to solve real problems and spark new possibilities.

## Core Focus

- **AI Engineering** – Multi-agent systems 🧭, LLM integrations, RAG pipelines 📚, smart APIs
- **Backend Development** – NestJS, Node.js, FastAPI, Express, event-driven systems microservices
- **Cloud & Infra** – AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2), Docker 🐳, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines
- **Data** – PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CosmosDB, caching layers, real-time pipelines ⚡

## Ethos

- Ship fast, but build to last 🚀
- Architect with clarity and purpose 🧩
- Automate workflows, eliminate friction 🔁
- Design for resilience, scale, and people 🔐
